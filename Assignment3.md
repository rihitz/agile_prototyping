## The identified problem

Sustainability

## The prototype that's been identified (the system/artefact)

3D modelling / 3D printing for a scale model

## Development stages

1. Identify problem
2. Idea generation and brainstorming
3. Background research, material selection
4. First iteration of sketches, design and general layout
5. 3D modelling
6. Testing, basic calculations
7. Deign iterations and refinement
8. Design review
9. Finalized design

## The identified features of the system

Description of the final solution (3D printed clay blocks, quake column, cardboard shading elements etc)

## How far back into the past have we gone (twice as far as you forecast)

## A conceptual model showing how the object has been defined over time

Final 3D model
