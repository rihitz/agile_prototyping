## Future gaps

In the context of our selected project, we believe that all three potential future scenarios generally will face similar challenges. As a result, we have compiled a comprehensive description of the gaps we have identified collectively.  

Among these gaps, in our opinion, the one that has the strongest presence, revolves around the sustainability of diverse construction materials and construction technologies. In today's design, the common practice often involves tailoring structures to meet specific client requirements. While such approach has its advantages, especially for the client side, a more sustainable design approach could prioritize flexibility and the potential for reusing materials or even the entire structure once it reaches the end of its service life.  

To bridge this gap, we must place our focus on conscientious design and material decisions for each and every project. It's convenient and admittedly, time-efficient, to follow well-threaded paths by adopting design approaches and materials that are tried, widely adopted and locally embraced. A prime example of this is the prevalent use of precast concrete elements in construction, due to their preference among local contractors and designers in Denmark. However, while precast concrete brings notable advantages such as reduced construction time and costs, it may not be the optimal choice if sustainable construction is the goal.  

The sustainability gap we've indentified directly impacts all three of our focus gene systems. We believe that all three systems are affected in a fairly balanced manner, with the Materials system likely playing the most significant role, given its prominence in sustainability discussions and its substantial contribution to CO2 emissions. It's important to recognize the interdependence of these systems, particularly how Materials and Structures are closely linked. It also applies to Construction (Build) systems as different construction methods often favor specific types of materials and/or structure types, emphasizing the need for environmentally conscious design.
