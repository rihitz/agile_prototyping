## Future gaps

In the context of our selected project, we believe that all three potential future scenarios generally will face similar challenges. As a result, we have compiled a comprehensive description of the gaps we have identified collectively.  

Among these gaps, in our opinion, the one that has the strongest presence, revolves around the sustainability of diverse construction materials and construction technologies. In today's design, the common practice often involves tailoring structures to meet specific client requirements. While such approach has its advantages, especially for the client side, a more sustainable design approach could prioritize flexibility and the potential for reusing materials or even the entire structure once it reaches the end of its service life.  

To bridge this gap, we must place our focus on conscientious design and material decisions for each and every project. It's convenient and admittedly, time-efficient, to follow well-threaded paths by adopting design approaches and materials that are tried, widely adopted and locally embraced. A prime example of this is the prevalent use of precast concrete elements in construction, due to their preference among local contractors and designers in Denmark. However, while precast concrete brings notable advantages such as reduced construction time and costs, it may not be the optimal choice if sustainable construction is the goal.  

The sustainability gap we've indentified directly impacts all three of our focus gene systems. We believe that all three systems are affected in a fairly balanced manner, with the Materials system likely playing the most significant role, given its prominence in sustainability discussions and its substantial contribution to CO2 emissions. It's important to recognize the interdependence of these systems, particularly how Materials and Structures are closely linked. It also applies to Construction (Build) systems as different construction methods often favor specific types of materials and/or structure types, emphasizing the need for environmentally conscious design.  

## System requirements

**Materials** - As elaborated in [A1](https://github.com/rihitz/agile_prototyping/blob/main/Assignment1.md), the materials used in our prototype project should be carefully chosen to facilitate sustainable construction practices. This encompasses, but is not limited to, the common objective of achieving carbon neutralitity or even better - net positivity, and in general minimizing the negative environmental impact. Furthermore, the potential for materials to be recyclable and construction elements to be reusable will be explored and prioritized.  
In an ideal scenario, we aspire to incorporate locally sourceable materials, such as region specific soils and clays, whenever feasable and structurally viable. The ability to do so, would be a great step towards sustainability, however, these material choices must still align with the project specifications, meeting the required strength and service parameters while also complying with the applicable building standards.

**Build** - The Roskilde Pavilion project places a specific set of requirements on the Build system. The structure must be erectable within a three day timeframe, reusable for at least three different occasions and user friendly for students from diverse study disciplines, thus ensuring an ever available set of helping hands, more specifically for the build-up and take-down processes. Moreover cost efficiency is of a great imprortance as there is an imposed budget cap of 150'000 DDK. These criteria imply that the structure should be relatively lightweight, easy to construct and not reliant on heavy machinery for assembly.

**Structure** - Building upon the previously outlined prerequisites, the structural system will integrate these requirements into a coherent project design. The pavilion's intended use cases, such as providing shade and shelter and potentially serving as a stage, will govern the design philosophy. Simultaneusly, the sustainable design principles will be applied by consciously selecting materials and construction methods. In our opinion, while hte main purpose of pavilion's structure design is to ensure its integrity, it should also act as a facilitator for achieving all of the previously outlined sustainability objectives.
